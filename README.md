Dataset is taken from:

1. One should first download the data from the source.
2. Then, one should run data_preprocessing.py to obtain the data in a good format.
3. Finally, one should choose one of the models and run it.

(i) Each of softmax_regression.py, dense_NN.py, cnn_scratch.py, cnn_transfer.py is a different model. The best model by far is cnn.transfer.py
(ii) Directories will be messed up if one tries to run the files immediately. Be sure to first fix any inconsistencies  there.
(iii) cnn_scratch.py and cnn_transfer.py should be run on a GPU
